The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design. For detailed implementation examples and explanations of how the Open Host Factory Plugin implements DIP, please refer to the SOLID Principles documentation.

## Quick Reference

The Dependency Inversion Principle states:

1. **High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.**
2. **Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.**
