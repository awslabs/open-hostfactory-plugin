## [1.0.0] - 2025-07-08

### Added

#### Core Platform Features

**AWS Cloud Provider Integration**
- EC2 Fleet Management with mixed instance types and availability zone distribution
- Auto Scaling Groups with configurable scaling policies and triggers
- Spot Fleet Integration for cost-optimized workload management
- Direct Instance Provisioning for simple use cases
- Unified AWS Operations with consistent error handling and retry mechanisms

**IBM Symphony Host Factory Compatibility**
- Complete Host Factory API implementation with all required endpoints
- Template discovery and metadata retrieval (`getAvailableTemplates`)
- Machine provisioning with advanced configuration options (`requestMachines`)
- Real-time request monitoring with detailed status information (`getRequestStatus`)
- Graceful machine termination and cleanup (`requestReturnMachines`)
- Return request status tracking (`getReturnRequests`)
- Legacy format support for backward compatibility with existing Symphony configurations

**Modern CLI Interface**
- Resource-action based command structure (templates, machines, requests, system)
- Multiple output formats: JSON, YAML, Rich Unicode tables, ASCII tables, list format
- Field control options:
  - Default: HF-compatible minimal fields (3 essential fields)
  - `--long`: Full configuration details (20+ fields)  
  - `--legacy`: camelCase field names for Symphony compatibility
- Rich table formatting with colors, borders, and proper alignment
- Comprehensive shell completion for bash and zsh
- Hybrid field mapping with special business logic and automatic conversion

**Template Management System**
- Template validation with comprehensive configuration checking
- Multi-format support for legacy and modern template definitions
- Template discovery with automatic metadata extraction
- Support for complex AWS configurations (subnets, security groups, instance types)

#### Architecture & Design

**Domain-Driven Design Implementation**
- Template bounded context for VM template management
- Machine bounded context for instance lifecycle management
- Request bounded context for provisioning workflow orchestration
- Clean separation of concerns with well-defined domain boundaries

**Event-Driven Architecture**
- Domain events for all business state changes
- Comprehensive event handling system for cross-cutting concerns
- Event sourcing with immutable event store and replay capabilities
- Audit trail generation for compliance and debugging

**Provider-Agnostic Design**
- Cloud-agnostic architecture with clean extension points
- Generic provider interface for easy addition of new cloud providers
- Zero cloud dependencies in domain layer

**Configuration Management**
- Unified configuration system with type-safe validation
- Multiple configuration sources: environment variables, files, defaults
- Legacy configuration support for backward compatibility
- Environment variable overrides with hierarchical system (HF_SECTION_FIELD format)
- Hot-reload capabilities for dynamic configuration updates

#### Reliability & Operations

**Error Handling & Resilience**
- Comprehensive error handling with hierarchical exception system

- Performance monitoring with request timing and throughput metrics
- Health checks for provider monitoring and capability discovery
- Complete audit trail for compliance and debugging
- Event sourcing for immutable audit logging

**Security & Compliance**
- AWS IAM integration with proper credential management
- Comprehensive input validation and request sanitization
- Secure error handling without sensitive data exposure
- Complete audit logging for compliance requirements

#### Developer Experience

**Testing & Quality Assurance**
- Comprehensive test suite with unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- Dry-run support for safe testing without resource provisioning
- Mock providers for development and CI/CD testing
- Code quality tools with pre-commit hooks and automated validation

**Documentation & Support**
- Professional documentation with MkDocs and GitLab Pages
- Comprehensive API reference with examples
- Developer setup and configuration guides
- Extension guides for adding new cloud providers

**Deployment & Distribution**
- Docker support with containerized deployment options
